# Modelshare

An easy way for non-technical users to upload a 3D environment, make adjustments, and share that environment with virtually anyone. Environments can be experienced on desktop/laptop, mobile, and VR headsets.

Allow clients to walkthrough a kitchen renovation, reference a project when you're not at the job-site, jump in VR to get inspired.
